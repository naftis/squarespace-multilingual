# multilingual Squarespace

The script allows you to make your Squarespace multilingual. The setup process is not very straightforward as this isn't a feature Squarespace supports by default.
The script is only tested with Bedford layout. Some knowledge of JavaScript and CSS is probably needed.

The code is based on this tutorial: https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/124120/how-to-build-a-multilingual-site-in-squarespace-7.html

## Installation

1. Change your pages' url slugs to /`lang`/`pagename`, example: /en/home or /ch/home.
2. Go to Settings > Advanced > Code Injection and insert the code to the Footer-section.
3. Change the allowedLanguages -array to your liking from the code.
